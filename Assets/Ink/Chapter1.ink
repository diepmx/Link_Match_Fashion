Evening. Lina, dressed modestly but neatly, carries a wrapped box. She pauses outside a café window, sees Daniel inside with Mira, laughing. Her heart leaps — at first with joy, then with confusion.

Daniel’s here… good, my surprise will work perfectly. He doesn’t suspect a thing.

She steps inside. The bell above the door jingles. She hears Mira’s voice, sharp with mockery.

#speaker: Mira
#protrait: Mira_mocking
#bg: Cafe
Seriously, this is what she buys you? A joke. I wouldn’t even use it to hang my dog’s collar.

#speaker: Daniel
#protrait: Daniel_Snickering

Don’t laugh too loudly… She tries, but honestly, being with her feels like dragging around dead weight. Always tired, always plain. I deserve better.

#narration

The words hit Lina like stones. Her grip tightens on the gift box. She steps forward, voice trembling but clear.

#speaker: Lina

Is that so, Daniel? …This is your idea of working late?

#speaker: Daniel
#protrait: Daniel_shocked
#bg: Cafe
L-Lina?! You—what are you doing here?!

#speaker: Mira
#protrait: Mira_gleaming
#bg: Cafe
Oh. So the charity case shows up. Perfect timing.

#speaker: Lina
#protrait: Lina_steady
#bg: Cafe
Yes, it’s from me. A watch. Bought after months of cleaning shifts. Cheap, maybe. But at least I bought it with my own hands… not by clinging to someone else’s wallet.

#speaker: Daniel
#protrait: Daniel_flustered
#bg: Cafe
Don’t start your drama here! You’re embarrassing me in front of everyone!

#speaker: Mira
#protrait: Mira_possessive
#bg: Cafe
Embarrassing you? She’s embarrassing herself. Look at her clothes, her hair… She doesn’t belong in places like this.

#speaker: Lina
#protrait: Lina_breaking
#bg: Cafe
I thought today mattered. I thought we mattered. But you know what? You’re right. I don’t belong here. Not with you.

#narration
#bg: Cafe
Silence. Customers glance their way. Mira, annoyed, grabs a cup of hot coffee and flicks it toward Lina. She gasps, trying to dodge, but the liquid splashes across her hand.

#speaker: Lina
#protrait: Lina_pain
#bg: Cafe
Ahh—it burns!

#speaker: Mira
#protrait: Mira_cold
#bg: Cafe
Ugly, clumsy, broke, and now even scarred. Who would ever want trash like you?

#narration
#bg: Street
Lina staggers back, face pale. She forces herself not to cry in front of them. She turns and stumbles out into the street, clutching her burned hand. Outside, Emma spots her and runs over.

#speaker: Emma
#protrait: Emma_concerned
#bg: Street
Lina! What happened?! Your hand—oh my god, it’s red and blistering! Who did this?!

#speaker: Lina
#protrait: Lina_weak
#bg: Street
…Maybe she was right, Emma. Maybe I really am… useless.

#speaker: Emma 
#protrait: Emma_fierce
#bg: Street
Don’t. Say. That. Not after everything you’ve done for him. You gave up your studies, you worked your fingers raw, you loved him more than he deserved. You’re not useless—he is.

#speaker: Lina
#protrait: Lina_whisper
#bg: Street
…Then why does it hurt so much to hear them say it?

#speaker: Emma
#protrait: Emma_gentle
#bg: Street
Because you cared. But now it’s time to stop caring about them and start caring about you. Come with me, Lina. Let me show you what I see when I look at you.

#narration
#bg: Street
Emma pulls Lina gently down the street, toward a boutique lit with warm golden lights.
